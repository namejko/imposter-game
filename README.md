# Peyton's Thanksgiving Family Imposter

A party game for Thanksgiving where one player secretly gets a different question than everyone else. Can you figure out who the imposter is?

## How to Play

1. The interviewer sets up two similar questions — one real, one for the imposter
2. Pass the phone around so each player sees their question privately
3. The interviewer asks the question out loud and everyone answers
4. Vote on who you think had the different question
5. Reveal the imposter!
